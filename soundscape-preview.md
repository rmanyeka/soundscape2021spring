Soundscape Preview
Today I sought out to begin my soundscape. I wanted to start in my room since I normally finish up doing homework around 6PM which is near my dinnertime. I did this by finding a free typing on a keyboard sound and started with that since I found my own typing sound was not adequate enough. Next I wanted a way to signify that I was no longer typing by the door opening and shutting. Therefore, I had the typing sound go on for a few seconds and a brief pause of silence as seen in audacity (I may add a sound of my own laptop shutting to show that I am done on the laptop). I do think the door opening and closing is a slightly dramatic, therefore I hope to come up with a better way to show that I am leaving the room.

Another way I was showing me leaving the room was the rain I decided to add. I tried to find a sound that had the rain splattering on the window, as it does in my apartment. The rain helped show me leaving the room since I edited the sound to fade out to show I was leaving my desk by my window to get up and open my door to leave. This may need touching up, but I like the idea thus far.

Some concerns I have is making sure I am able to make the story coherent. A lot of this makes sense in my head but I realized once I tried to make it work on Audacity it does not flow, so I hope to spend more time working on that aspect of the project. My next challenge is the dinner aspect which will most likely be my own assets.
